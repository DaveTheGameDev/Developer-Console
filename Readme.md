# Developer Console

I made this system to handle executing commands for C# games.
This project has been setup as a unity package but can be used in any C# project.

Add this to your unity project through the package manifest
"https://github.com/DaveTheGameDev/Developer-Console.git",

If you find a bug or have a suggestion feel free to open an issue or a create a pull request

## Example Usage

### Console Command

Commands must be static methods. The reason i designed it to not support non static methods is because i felt as though it would lead to spaghetti code if you have random commands thrown into gameplay code.With static methods you can have your commands self contained in a single static class that accesses managers for specific gameplay objects.

```cs
// Commands can have multiple command aliases
[ConCommand("testcmd")]
[ConCommandDesc("Explain how to use this command and what it does here")]
private static void Clear()
{
    ConsoleSystem.Clear();
}
```

Commands use explicit types for command parameters
You can use any built in C# data type

* bool
* byte
* sbyte
* decimal
* double
* float
* int
* uint
* long
* ulong
* short
* ushort
* char
* string

Example command with parameters

```cs
[ConCommand("add", "clears the console window")]
[ConCommandDesc("add 1 2")]
private static void Add(int a, int b)
{
   DevConsole.LogMessage((a + b).ToString());
}
```

### ConVar

Console variables are a way to manipulate a static field. You can use these for stuff like storing settings for game variables and user settings.

Convars support types listed above.

```CS
[ConVar] private static int ExampleConVar;

```

Setting Convar

```CS
DevConsole.ExecuteCommand($"exampleconvar {value}")
```

You can output convar value

```cs
// Print ExampleConVar value to console
DevConsole.ExecuteCommand("exampleconvar")
```

## known Issues / Limitations

* Docs for adding new types as parameters do not exist yet. To add new commands you can take a look at DevConsoleHelper.cs

## TODO

* [ ] Convar on changed hooks (useful for network syncing variables)
* [ ] Dynamic Type Registration
* [ ] Focused Object System
* [ ] Code Documentation and Wiki
* [ ] Ensure code is as clean as possible
